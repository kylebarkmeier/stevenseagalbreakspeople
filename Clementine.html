<br><b>Comments:</b> OH DEAR LORD. This movie is <b>pathetic</b>. It's a Korean film about some loser Tae Kwon Do fighter, and it's basically a huge drama/soap opera, only worse than daytime ABC/NBC/whatever. They had one sad orchestral track, and they played it <b>all the time</b>, and people were almost always crying about something, anything, who knows! Seagal has a miniscule part at the end, and <b>he is the bad guy! What the fuck?!</b> He can't be the bad guy! That ruins everything! This movie is like a big "FUCK YOU!" from Korea. Well, fuck you, too, Korea. Fuck you, too.
