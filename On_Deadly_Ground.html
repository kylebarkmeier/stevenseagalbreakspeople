   <b>One-liners:</b> Evil Oil Guy: "Go ahead, shoot me! You've haven't got the balls!" Seagal: "I wouldn't dirty my bullets." Seagal's Lady: "Dirty one for me, Forrest!"<br>
[In reference to Seagal's expertise] Merc Leader: "My guy in D.C. tells me that we are not dealing with the student here, we're dealing with the professor. Anytime the military has an operation that can't fail, they call this guy in to train the troops, ok? He's the kind of guy that would drink a gallon of gasoline just to piss in your campfire. You could drop this guy off in the Artic circle wearing a pair of bikini underwear without his toothbrush, and tomorrow afternoon he's gonna show up at your poolside with a million dollar smile and a fistful of pesos. This guy's a professional, ya got me? If he reaches this rig, we're all going to be nothing but a big goddamn hole right in the middle of Alaska. So let's find him and kill him and get rid of the son of a bitch!"   </td>

<b>Comments:</b> This movie owns for the simple reason that Seagal uses a 2-liter soda bottle to silence his 1911 .45ACP.
