Here's what the different stars mean about each movie. It's not determined by how many bones are broken, usually on how awesome the movie is as a whole.<BR><br>

   <td>

   </td><td>= Pure ownage. This movie obviously has lots of bad-ass shit. Pulls out all the stops in terms of cool weapons, hilarious lines, and lots of killing
   <hr noshade width=80% align=left>
   </td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
   <td>
   <font size=+1>****</font>
   </td><td>= Pretty damn good. Lots of action, and rarely a dull moment. Definitely worth your time seeing it, as you can expect some excellent kills more than a few snapped limbs.
   <hr noshade width=80% align=left>
   </td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
   </td><td>
   <font size=+1>***</font>
   </td><td>
   = Average. Moves at an okay pace; just enough to keep you interested. Possibly a few gems hidden in here, but not enough to make it <cite>really</cite> good.
   <hr noshade width=80% align=left>
   </td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
   <td>
   <font size=+1>**</font>
   </td><td>= Meh. Way too slow, all the good parts are too spread out, and there appears to be a lot of filler.
   <hr noshade width=80% align=left>
   </td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
   <td>
   <font size=+1>*</font>
   </td><td>
   = Pretty bad. Slow and tedious, nothing much happens, and what does happen is loosely connected to other sporadic events, and generally confusing.
   <hr noshade width=80% align=left>
   </td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
   <td>
   <b>0</b>
   </td><td>
   = Horrid. Nothing, NOTHING happens. Struggle to stay awake, let alone interested. Nobody has anything broken, very few people are killed, this movie sucks.
   <hr noshade width=80% align=left>
   </td></tr>
<tr valign=top>
   <td valgin=top>
   <b>Shit</b>
   </td><td>
   = <a href="Half_Past_Dead.html">Half Past Dead</a>. Don't get me started. Nobody gets anything broken. Few people die by Seagal's hand. Fighting scenes are filmed in incomprehensibly fast, quick shots. AN OLD SENATOR LADY IS MOLESTED.
